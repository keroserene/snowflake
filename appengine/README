This component runs on Google App Engine. It lies between meek-client
and meek-server. The App Engine component receives requests from the
client and forwards them to the server, then receives responses from the
server and forwards them to the client.

You need the Go App Engine SDK in order to deploy the app.
	https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/#linux
After unpacking, install the app-engine-go component:
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud components install app-engine-go

To test locally, run
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/dev_appserver.py app.yaml
The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/. You can test broker
forwarding function by browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ip.

To deploy to App Engine, first create a new project and app. You have to
think of a unique name (marked as "<appname>" in the commands). You only
have to do the "create" step once; subsequent times you can go straight
to the "deploy" step. This command will open a browser window so you can
log in to a Google account.
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud projects create <appname>
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud app create --project=<appname>
Then to deploy the project, run:
	google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud app deploy --project=<appname>

To configure meek-client to talk to the App Engine app, provide
"https://<appname>.appspot.com/" as the url and "www.google.com" as the
front domain.

	Bridge meek 0.0.2.0:1 url=https://example.appspot.com/ front=www.google.com
